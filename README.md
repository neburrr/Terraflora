The planet is in an agonizing and irreversible climate situation that humanity needs to resolve. The agricultural sector destroyed areas crucial to the planet’s environmental balance to respond
to excessive demand for food. And by 2050, there will be 9.7 billion people on Earth, of which
around 2.5 billion will live in cities. So, to solve these problems that humanity faces, it is necessary
to reinvent the way food is produced with more efficient and environmentalist forms of cultivation.


One solution to this is to increase each person’s self-sustainability by growing their own food.
Greenhouses are structures that provide plants with a controlled environment for their growth.
Control requires the acquisition of temperature, humidity, and light intensity values and their respective acting through microcontrollers and decision systems so that these values are always
within acceptable limits. Decision-making can be based on the physical conditions of the plant,
visual processing of its appearance, or through previously carried out studies that indicate nominal
values for the plant’s level of development. If control is carried out well, it is possible to create a
micro-ecosystem capable of producing food efficiently at any time of the year.


In this way, it is proposed to build an intelligent greenhouse capable of providing a given
plant with the necessary conditions for its growth. Efficient control methods, image extraction
mechanisms, and real-time monitoring systems are suggested. The results presented with the
cultivation of lettuce for 28 days allows to state that the implemented control methods managed to
save water by around seven times. This repository has all the code for the greenhouse monitor and system control.
